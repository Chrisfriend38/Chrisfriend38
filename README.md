## 👋 Hey, I’m Chris Friend

I’m an aspiring Software Developer with a strong interest in building practical, well-structured applications. I’m currently developing my skills across the full stack while completing the Northcoders Full-Stack JavaScript Bootcamp, where I work on real-world projects using modern web technologies.
I enjoy problem-solving, learning new tools, and working with others to create software that’s reliable, scalable, and user-focused. I’m now focused on turning this passion into a long-term career in software engineering.

🚀 My Journey & What’s Next
After spending time in stakeholder-facing roles and collaborating closely with engineering teams in large organisations, I discovered a genuine passion for technology and software development. This led me to retrain and fully commit to a career in software engineering.

Through Northcoders, I’m gaining hands-on experience designing and building full-stack applications with React, Node.js, Express, SQL, and TDD. I’m particularly interested in writing clean, maintainable code and understanding how software works end to end.

Looking ahead, I’m keen to join a supportive development team where I can continue to grow, contribute to meaningful projects, and strengthen my technical foundations while delivering real value.

🌱 Currently Learning
Improving full-stack architecture and API design
Writing more robust tests
Building production-ready applications
